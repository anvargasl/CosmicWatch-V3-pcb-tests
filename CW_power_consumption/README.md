This folder contains some measurements made (current and tension) to test the power consumption of CosmicWatch while collecting data for gamma spectroscopy, all this while displaying data on the OLED screen, flashing the LED for every event, and recording temperature and preassure with the BMP280 sensor.

### CW_booting.csv

Power consumption data while initiating the detector.

### CW_high_count_rate.csv

Power consumption data while measuring a high count rate (next to a 54Mn source with 0.612 Mbq activity).

### CW_normal_working_conditions.csv

Power consumption data while measuring only background radiation from the enviroment and self-absorption of a 4x4x22 mm cubed LYSO crystal.

### CW_power_consumption.set

Contains the setup data for the Keithley Series 2280S High Precision Bench Power Supply used to measure current and tension.

### CW_power_measurements.txt

Shows some of the data collected by the CosmicWatch while testing its power consumption.
